# Y

Y is an open-source social media platform. We aim to provide overly simple text "status updates" tied to accounts. 
It's simple. lightweight, fast, and can be implemented on linux servers easily.

## DEMO

- **Test today!:** On my website, like all my projects, you can test the app without without running it

- **Privacy First:** We prioritize user privacy. That's why all passwords are hashed. If one can manage to gain access to the database, a password will have a lot of obfusication. 

- **Open Source:** Y is open-source software, which means you can contribute to its development, audit the code, and ensure transparency in how your data is handled.


## Installation
